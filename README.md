### General Info
This project was a simple one. I created an animation and a class in my CSS that was set to run infinite. When the page loaded I loaded up the content in a function that was placed inside a setTimeout function with a delay long enough for the content to be loaded in and see the cool animation placeholder. Inside the Data function is where I removed the class with the infinite animation.
